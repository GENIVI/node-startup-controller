    @short_description: Interface for receiving Shutdown commands from the NSM

    Shutdown Consumers are D-Bus object which are created to shut down apps
    which do not have a Shutdown() D-Bus method to call. These are registered
    with the Node State Manager (NSM) instead of the apps and shut down those
    apps when Shutdown() is called on the Shutdown Consumer.

      Shuts down the app the ShutdownConsumer is associated with.
