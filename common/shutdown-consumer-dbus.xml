    @short_description: Interface for receiving LifecycleRequest commands from the NSM

    Lifecycle Consumers are D-Bus object which are created to shut down apps
    which do not have a LifecycleRequest() D-Bus method to call. These are registered
    with the Node State Manager (NSM) instead of the apps and respond to any 
    LifecycleRequest() in the app's place.

    <!--
      Shutdown:
      @Request: The code for this request, either normal, fast or runup.
      @RequestId: A unique identifier for this lifecycle consumer, used in the 
                  LifecycleRequestComplete signal which replies to the NSM.

      Shuts down or starts up the app the LifecycleConsumer is associated with.
