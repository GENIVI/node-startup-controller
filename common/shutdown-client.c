/**
 * SECTION: shutdown-client
 * @title: ShutdownClient
 * @short_description: A class to bundle information about a #ShutdownConsumer.
 * @stability: Internal
 * 
 * The #ShutdownClient is a container for a #ShutdownConsumerSkeleton if it is being used
 * by the #LAHandlerService in the Node Startup Controller, and a #ShutdownConsumerProxy 
 * if it is being used by the #NSMConsumerService in the Node State Manager Dummy.
 * 
 * In addition, it contains the following information:
 *
 * * The bus name, the name that the controlling process owns on the system bus.
 *
 * * The object path, a unique D-Bus object path which, together with the bus name,
 *   is used by the Node State Manager to identify the #ShutdownConsumer.
 *
 * * The shutdown mode, an #NSMShutdownType.
 *
 * * The timeout, the amount of time the Node State Manager will wait before deciding
 *                that this #ShutdownClient is not responding.
 *
 * The #LAHandlerService uses it to identify which #ShutdownConsumer was told to shut
 * down, which it will then use to stop the associated systemd unit.
 *
 * The #NSMConsumerService uses it to locate the #ShutdownConsumer, shut it down with the
 * appropriate mode, and wait for an appropriate length of time when expecting a response.
