    @short_description: Interface for testing the interaction between Boot
                        Manager and Node State Manager.
                        It is a summary of
                        "com.conti.NodeStateManager.LifecycleControl" using
                        only the methods needed to test Boot Manager.

      @BusName: Bus name of remote application.
      @ObjName: Object name of remote object that provides the shutdown
                interface

      The method is used by other applications to register themselves as
      shutdown client. Any client that registers must provide a method in
      their DBUS object called NSMLifecycleRequest. This method will take one
      parameter which is the Lifecycle Request (i.e. normal shutdown, fast
      shutdown, runup). For an example of the required client interface
      please see the Boot Manager component who will be a client of the NSM.
