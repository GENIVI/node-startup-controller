Build Instructions
------------------

In order to build the boot manager, run the following:

  gtkdocize &&
  autoreconf -ivf &&
  ./configure [options] &&
  make

The following configure options are available apart from the standard
choices:

  --enable-debug=<yes|no>:

    Enables or disables debug builds. Enabling
    debug will cause more compiler warnings to
    be generated that are then treated as errors
    and make the build fail. This is useful for
    catching problems during development.

    The default is "no".

  --with-prioritised-luc-types=<comma-separated integers>:

    Allows to define an ordered list of LUC types to be prioritised
    during start-up.

    The default is an empty list.

For more information about all available configure options, run:

  ./configure --help
