Build Dependencies
------------------

The following libraries need to be installed in order to be able to
build the Node Startup Controller:

  automotive-dlt >= 2.2.0
  gio-2.0 >= 2.30.0
  glib-2.0 >= 2.30.0
  gobject-2.0 >= 2.30.0
  libsystemd-daemon >= 183

In addition to this, and apart from the standard tools like autoreconf,
automake and libtool, the following command-line utilities need to be
available for building:

  gdbus-codegen
  gtkdocize (and related GTK-Doc tools)


Build Instructions
------------------

In order to build the Node Startup Controller, run the following:

  (test -d m4 || mkdir m4) &&
  gtkdocize &&
  autoreconf -ivf &&
  ./configure [options] &&
  make

The following configure options are available apart from the standard
choices:

  --enable-debug=<yes|no>:

    Enables or disables debug builds. Enabling
    debug will cause more compiler warnings to
    be generated that are then treated as errors
    and make the build fail. This is useful for
    catching problems during development.

    The default is "no".

  --with-prioritised-luc-types=<comma-separated integers>:

    Allows to define an ordered list of LUC types to be prioritised
    during start-up.

    The default is an empty list.

For more information about all available configure options, run:

  ./configure --help


Install Instructions
--------------------

To install the Node Startup Controller after having built it, run:

  make install


Testing Instructions
--------------------

To run any test suites shipped with the Node Startup Controller, run:

  make check

There may also be some post-install tests that can only be performed
after installing the Node Startup Controller into the system. Those
can be executed with:

  make installcheck
