    <title>Notes about the NSM dummy behaviour</title>
    <para>
      We do not guarantee that our NSM dummy is functional equivalent to
      the real NSM. The dummy does however, provide the same interfaces and
      the behaviour of all public methods used by the Node Startup
      Controller should be very similar to that of the real NSM.
    </para>
    <para>
      We implemented a few special features in the NSM dummy that make
      testing the Node Startup Controller easier:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <literal>com.contiautomotive.NodeStateManager.LifecycleControl.CheckLucRequired</literal>
        will alternative between returning <literal>TRUE</literal> and
        <literal>FALSE</literal> with every call. This way we can test how the
        Node Startup Controller behaves with and without starting the LUC simply by
        starting it twice.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <literal>com.contiautomotive.NodeStateManager.LifecycleControl.SetNodeState</literal>
        will alternative between accepting the state and not accepting the state with
        every call. This way we can test how the Node Startup Controller handles both
        scenarios.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        The NSM dummy will shut down all registered shutdown consumers upon receiving
        <literal>SIGHUP</literal>. This allows to test the shutdown sequence by running
        the following command:
        <programlisting>kill -s HUP $(pidof nsm-dummy)</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Unlike the real NSM, which only ever shuts down using one shutdown
        mode, the NSM dummy will shut down the consumers for all modes.
        The modes are isolated from each other to avoid undesired
        side-effects of this difference in implementation.
