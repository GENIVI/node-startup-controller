  <para>
    Along with our implementation of the Node Startup Controller, this software package
    also ships a dummy implementation of the Node State Manager (NSM). This is done in
    order to make testing possible even though the actual NSM implementation has not
    landed in GENIVI yet.

    <title>Notes about the NSM dummy behaviour</title>
    <para>
      The NSM dummy is not guaranteed to be functionally equivalent to the real NSM. The
      dummy does however, provide the same interfaces and the behaviour of all public
      methods used by the Node Startup Controller should be very similar to that of the
      real NSM.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following special features are implemented in the NSM dummy that make testing
      the Node Startup Controller easier:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <literal>org.genivi.NodeStateManager.LifecycleControl.CheckLucRequired</literal>
        will alternate between returning <literal>TRUE</literal> and
        <literal>FALSE</literal> with every call. This way it is possible to test how the
        Node Startup Controller behaves with and without starting the LUC simply by
        starting it twice.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <literal>org.genivi.NodeStateManager.LifecycleControl.SetNodeState</literal>
        will alternate between accepting the state and not accepting the state with
        every call. This way it is possible to test how the Node Startup Controller
        handles both scenarios.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        The NSM dummy will shut down all registered shutdown consumers upon receiving
        <literal>SIGHUP</literal>. It is possible to test the shutdown sequence by running
        the following command:
        <programlisting>kill -s HUP $(pidof nsm-dummy)</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Unlike the real NSM, which only ever shuts down using one shutdown
        mode, the NSM dummy will shut down the consumers for all modes.
        The modes are isolated from each other to avoid undesired
        side-effects of this difference in implementation.
